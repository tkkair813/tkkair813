## Hi there 👋, I'm Taylor!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a biologist 🧬👨‍🔬 turned software engineer 🧑‍💻. My journey started during the COVID pandemic when all lab workers were sent home for shelter-in-place. To be productive lab-worker without being in a lab, I started writing Python scripts to process and visualize lab data. Since then I've been trying to bridge the gap between scientist and software developers!

### 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On
